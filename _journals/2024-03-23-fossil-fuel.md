and again, i'm digging / for the hand around my neck / for those mud-blind eyes / for that tasteless thing to chew / and swallow / <br>
<br>
/ for the swallow outside the window while my father bangs on the bedroom door /  for the bathroom's stone cold floor / for that finger in my mouth / for that tasteless thing to shove / and spit / for <br>
<br>
confession. / i'm digging, again, for gray soil caked in my fingertips / for an altar boy's fingers holding mine / for the priest's facsimile words / for<br>
<br>
school uniform and tennis shoes standing in the pulpit / for feet sunken into the lake's muddy sand / for gravel-scarred hands / for <br>
<br>
rocks pelted at my back / i'm digging, parched-tongue, for all-eyes-on-me for heads-down-thumbs-up for signs of the cross / for<br>
<br>
hands wandering silent / for the hem of my skirt / for bitten pillow / for bitten tongue / for hand on mouth / for held breath<br>
<br>
for the kneeling, writhing child at the center of the earth.
